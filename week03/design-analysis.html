			<h2>Design Principles</h2>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

			<h3>Proximity &mdash; Enrique Sanchez</h3>

			<p>
					DoTerra has a very good way of grouping elements in their site. One interesting example is the banner at the top of the picture, The picture shows products sold by the company, mixed with elements that they use to create them. They put them together and the reader will know that both elements are contected. Otherwise, the oranges diplayed in the picture would look very odd and out of place. Also, they put the oil bottles right underneath the logo of the company. That way, the reader will associate the bottles to the company and will remember who makes these products. This is a way to group elements.
			</p>

			<h3>Alignment &mdash; Idianis Ortiz</h3>

			<p>
					DoTERRA applied a good alignment in its design. All of the sentences were perfectly aligned not only at the beginning of the sentences but also at the end. They also used a flush right margin to make more emphasis on the second paragraph.  On the other hand, their images were also aligned from top to the bottom. 
			</p>

			<h3>Repetition &mdash; Enrique Sanchez</h3>
			<img src="pictures/repitition.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
			<p>
					It is very interesting how doTerra adds its name to different parts of the website so that the reader will remember the name. Also, it uses the same colors throughout the site, so that when the reader sees those colors, they will associate them with the brand, and that will attract more costumers. They also show the bottles of their product often so that the viewer will have them in mind and will also become a costumer.
			</p>

			<h3>Contrast &mdash; Idianis Ortiz</h3>
			<p>Example 1</p>
			<img src="pictures/contrast.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
			<p>
					To create contrast, doTERRA used a colored picture showing that some drops were getting into someoneâ€™s hands and a black and white image to create differentiation between the images. The contrast that they used for that design was based on color. 
			</p>
			<p>Example 2</p>
			<img src="pictures/contrast2.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
			<p>
					From the previous example, we can see that doTERRA used contrast in the font too. They used big letters for the title and smaller letters for the rest of the information to create more impact. They also combine bold and not bold letters to create more contrast.
